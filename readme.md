# Tic-Tac-Toe in Expo

This project is a recreation of a React web application from new [react beta docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) for use on mobile devices using React Native with Expo.

This project was inspired by a tweet from [@mattcarrollcode](https://twitter.com/mattcarrollcode/status/1629262255744503809?s=46&t=ArQ2YykoGCclA2p0py4niw), in which he shared his inaugural project in [@reactjs](https://twitter.com/reactjs)

The `assets` directory contains fonts and images used in the application. The `components` directory contains reusable components used throughout the application. The `screens` directory contains the screens for the application, which are navigated using the React Navigation library.
